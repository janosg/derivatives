## To-DOs

- Implement jacobians for the six functions in `kernel_transformations.py`
- Test them againts jacobians calculated with jax. Check the [autodiff cookbook](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/autodiff_cookbook.html#Jacobians-and-Hessians-using-jacfwd-and-jacrev) to see how to take jacobians of functions. Jax differentiable versions of the functions are already implemented in `kernel_transformations_jax.py`. Draw many (at least 50) random inputs with different sizes to be sure that the functions do what they should.
